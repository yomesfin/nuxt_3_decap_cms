When people ask me what I do for work, I tell them I’m a writer. It’s not my job title. But it is my craft. It’s the skill I bring to digital product design teams.

Yet the label, while true, always feels incomplete. It doesn’t really capture the scope of what I do all day.

I’ve been thinking more and more about how writers fit in on different design teams. So many companies and agencies limit the opportunity of writers. They don’t let writers run big projects. Or they reduce writing to a narrowly defined task (“fix the error messages”). Some places don’t even *hire* writers.

But in my experience, successful teams have one thing in common. They keep the discipline of writing on equal footing with design.

Writers aren’t called in at the last minute to “wordsmith” or “do a copy pass.” Because by that point, writers can only help so much. Instead, writers co-create flows *alongside* designers. We share Figma files. We come up with solutions together. We stay close from kickoff to launch.

There’s teamwork. But even more important, there’s respect. Both sides understand the importance of the other.

It’s simple. Good design teams invite writers to share in the entire creative process. Because they recognize: writers do a lot.

**Writers build user trust.** We do it by paying attention to craft and quality. When I worked on a product for a financial company, we had a very strict “zero mistakes” rule. If our users couldn’t trust us with punctuation, how could they ever trust us with their retirement?

**Writers inspire.** A well-articulated thought or phrase can unlock new interfaces and new ideas.

**Writers make products more usable.** If an interface has text, the words need to be perfect. Bad writing breaks the most beautiful UI. The secret to good UX writing is good UX *writers*.

**Writers name.** A new company, app, or product. We help decide exactly what to call it.

**Writers choose good words.** We define brand and product vocabulary. There’s a big difference between *favorites* and *wishlist* and *saved.* We help decide which one works best.

A single well-chosen word can shape the experience.

**Writers work from nothing.** In fact, we’re used to starting with a blank page. Give us an empty Figma file and we get to work on the flow, messaging, and content.

**Writers shape narratives.** We frame ideas, tell stories, and know how to introduce brands to new audiences. We invite users in through compelling product onboardings. We explain in a way that resonates.

**Writers know where language is going.** We pay close attention to slang, neologisms, emerging expressions, and communication trends. We balance traditional grammar rules with modern usage.

**Writers add personality.** We can add humor, warmth, enthusiasm, you name it. The best brands have a unique voice. Writers define that voice, then bring it to life.

Even simple questions are an opportunity to build the brand voice.

**Writers introduce and explain new features.** We create value props, engage the audience, and explain what matters most.

**Writers align global design teams.** Brazil. Italy. South Korea. Japan. There are talented product designers from all over the world, many of whom speak different languages. A writer who’s mastered the local language can help the whole team move forward.

**Writers explain things clearly.** We turn complex ideas and into jargon-free sentences. We make complicated interactions into simple flows. We help users know what to do next.

**Writers make products accessible.** Adding alt text doesn’t help if the text is clunky and confusing.

**Writers make products inclusive.** We understand how to write for all people. We’re familiar with modern phrasing, preferred terminology, and potential for harm.

**Writers delete.** Some UIs don’t need words. We know that. So when the writing’s not helping, we get rid of it.

Some screens need *less* writing, not more.

**Writers make interactions clear.** Perfect questions. Unambiguous choices. Simple buttons. We write them all.

**Writers balance legal needs with user needs.** We meet with lawyers, understand their concerns, and find a way to keep the prose clean.

**Writers determine the right content.** Does your fitness app need FAQs? A compendium of sneaker brands? A guide to running in Lagos? We put together an approach based on what’s right for the brand, product, and audience.

**Writers add helpful structure.** We know what belongs in a header and what’s better explained in the subhead. We know what needs two sentences and what needs four paragraphs.

Different type styles and sentence constructions can make the same message land differently.

**Writers run design projects.** When given the opportunity, we manage teams and keep people inspired. We get great ideas and great products out into the world.

**Writers optimize for translation and localization.** If the audience is global, we can help. Some writing is easy to translate and some is near-impossible. Writers understand the difference.

**Writers keep details consistent.** Like brand nomenclature, what gets capitalized, and how to format dates. Consistency creates a better, more usable product.

**Writers manage and mentor other writers.** As teams grow, we help our colleagues get better at their craft. Every writing team should be run by a writer. The person in charge needs to fully understand the discipline.

**More than anything, writers elevate the people around them.** We help our design teammates get unstuck. We bring a different kind of thinking, a different set of skills. Then we work together to solve problems. The result? Better interfaces, happier people, more launches, and less endless swirl.

Writers aren’t nice to have—they’re necessary. And when design and writing align from the beginning, the result is nothing short of spectacular.
